# **App Name**: AI Assistant Demo: Transformers, RAG, CAG, KAG

## Core Features:

- Prompt Input: Text input area for user questions.
- Document Upload: File upload functionality for documents to be used with RAG.
- Context Setting: UI elements (dropdowns or form) to set user context (age, expertise, tone) for CAG.
- Fact Input: Optional textbox for manual fact input (for KAG).
- Output Display: Display the final AI-generated response using RAG, CAG, and KAG.
- Transformer Generation: Use a transformer-based model to generate fluent and human-like responses to user prompts.
- RAG Integration: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant content from uploaded documents and use it to augment answers. The tool will decide whether to mention where the retrieved context originated.
- CAG Implementation: Implement Context-Aware Generation (CAG) to tailor the assistant's responses based on user-specified context (age, expertise, tone).
- KAG Implementation: Implement Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) to incorporate user-provided facts directly into the generated responses. The tool will decide whether the injected fact needs to be cited in the answer.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A subdued violet (#9466a9) chosen to evoke thoughtfulness, expertise, and sophisticated technology, reflecting the capabilities the application puts on display.
- Background color: Light gray (#f2f2f2), a very slightly violet-shifted background creates a calm, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Light blue (#74a9c0), an analogous hue, provides a complementary contrast and indicates interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a modern, slightly techy and scientific look. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for readability and a clean, objective appearance. 
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying snippets.
- Simple, clear icons for file upload and settings, focusing on ease of use.
- Clean and intuitive layout, with input areas clearly separated from the output display. Use of cards to organize different functionalities.
- Subtle animations during content loading and generation to improve user experience.
